# Voice-Recording-Solution

## Problem Statement

Despite the widespread adoption of call recording and analytics in contact centers, in-person customer interactions at physical service branches remain largely undocumented and unanalyzed. This creates a significant gap in quality assurance, customer sentiment tracking, and dispute resolution in high-volume walk-in environments such as banks, telecoms, and government offices.

Traditional customer experience tools are designed for telephony or digital channels and do not support real-time voice capture at physical locations. As a result, organizations lack critical visibility into face-to-face engagementsâ€”leading to inconsistent service quality, limited audit capabilities, and missed opportunities for operational improvement and regulatory compliance.
